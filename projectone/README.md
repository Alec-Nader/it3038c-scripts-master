I decided to re-use the plugin that I used for my Project One assignment but I added some more functionality to it.

Hopefully this link works for you: https://github.uc.edu/naderaj/it3038c-scripts/tree/master/projectone

otherwise it is located at : https://github.uc.edu/naderaj/it3038c-scripts under projectone folder.

This is a python script created to display disk sizes, memory sizes, cpus, and active users. This script integrates a python plugin, psutil, to create a disk,memory and cpu object with the required parameters that I need to pull system information. 

To run the script, first install the psutil plugin through PIP which is automatically integrated with python. (I installed this with powershell by typing : "pip install psutil")

Here is a link for documentation regarding installing Psutil through PIP: 

https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/blob/master/INSTALL.rst

Next, download the python file from my Git repository and run it through terminal or powershell.
